# FILE: 2-configmap.yaml
# PURPOSE: Stores non-sensitive configuration data for the application
# ============================================================================
#
# DESCRIPTION:
# ConfigMaps allow you to decouple configuration from container images, making
# your applications more portable and easier to manage. This ConfigMap stores
# environment-specific settings that can be injected into pods.
#
# BENEFITS:
# - Change configuration without rebuilding images
# - Share configuration across multiple pods
# - Separate configuration from application code
# - Update running applications by restarting pods
#
# CONFIGURATION VALUES:
# - APP_NAME: Human-readable application name
# - APP_VERSION: Application version identifier
# - PORT: Port number the application listens on
#
# USAGE:
# These values are injected into pods as environment variables using 'envFrom'
# in the deployment configurations (files 3 and 4).
#
# NOTE: For sensitive data (passwords, API keys), use Secrets instead of ConfigMaps
