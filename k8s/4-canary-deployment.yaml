# FILE: 4-canary-deployment.yaml
# PURPOSE: Deploys the canary (test) version for gradual feature rollout
# ============================================================================
#
# DESCRIPTION:
# This is the CANARY deployment used to test new features, updates, or bug fixes
# with a small subset of users before rolling out to all production traffic.
# This implements the "canary release" pattern for safe deployments.
#
# CANARY DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY:
# The canary deployment allows you to:
# - Test new features with real production traffic
# - Detect issues early with minimal user impact
# - Validate performance under real-world conditions
# - Roll back quickly if problems are detected
# - Gain confidence before full production rollout
#
# KEY FEATURES:
# - 1 replica (can scale to 3 via HPA in file 8)
# - Uses the 'canary' Docker image tag (pre-production version)
# - Handles approximately 25% of traffic (1 out of 4 total pods)
# - Limited blast radius - only affects 25% of users if issues occur
#
# HEALTH CHECKS:
# - Same liveness and readiness probes as stable
# - Ensures canary pods meet same health standards
# - Failed health checks prevent traffic routing
#
# RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
# - Same resource requests/limits as stable deployment
# - Ensures fair comparison between versions
# - Prevents resource-related performance differences
#
# PROMOTION PROCESS:
# 1. Deploy canary with new features
# 2. Monitor metrics (errors, latency, resource usage)
# 3. If successful: Update stable deployment to use canary image
# 4. If issues found: Scale canary to 0 or delete
