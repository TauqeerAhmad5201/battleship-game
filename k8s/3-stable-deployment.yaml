# FILE: 3-stable-deployment.yaml
# PURPOSE: Deploys the production-stable version of the Space Battle Game
# ============================================================================
#
# DESCRIPTION:
# This is the STABLE deployment that serves the majority of production traffic.
# It runs the tested, reliable version of your application that has been
# validated through the canary deployment process.
#
# KEY FEATURES:
# - 3 replicas for high availability and load distribution
# - Uses the 'latest' Docker image tag (production-ready version)
# - Handles approximately 75% of traffic (3 out of 4 total pods)
# - Auto-scaling enabled via HPA (file 7) - can scale from 3 to 10 pods
#
# HEALTH CHECKS:
# - Liveness Probe: Restarts container if app becomes unresponsive
#   * Checks HTTP GET / every 10 seconds
#   * Fails after 3 consecutive failures
# - Readiness Probe: Removes pod from service if not ready
#   * Checks HTTP GET / every 5 seconds
#   * Faster response ensures quick traffic routing
#
# RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
# - Requests: CPU 100m, Memory 128Mi (guaranteed resources)
# - Limits: CPU 500m, Memory 512Mi (maximum allowed)
# - Prevents resource starvation and ensures fair scheduling
#
# DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY:
# - RollingUpdate by default (zero-downtime deployments)
# - Gradually replaces old pods with new ones
# - Always maintains minimum availability
